== PROJECT: Centralised Human Resource System (CHRS)

---

== Overview

Centralised Human Resource System (CHRS) is an application for managing employees within the company.
The application is created to assist the Human Resource Department of the company to better manage the employees' information.
CHRS is capable of checking work schedule, creating recruitment posts, checking of expenses claims and storage of various information of each employee such as salary, department, position, etc.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added `filter` and enhanced `find` command
** What it does: It provides the end user with search functions whereby they can choose to filter employees by their department or rank/position or both. Additionally, the find command has been enhanced to be capable of searching by either the employee's name or his/her employee ID.
** Justification: This feature gives the users the capability of searching for either a specific employee or all employees of a certain rank/position or employees within a certain department.
** Highlights: This enhancement enhances the user experience when searching for certain employee(s) within CHRS, users will no longer need to scroll through the whole list to search for a specific employee(s) data. This enhancement required an in-depth understanding of the human resource department needs. Additionally, the implementation was challenging as it requires a great understanding of how predicates work in java to allow the commands to show the right employee(s) that the user is searching for.
