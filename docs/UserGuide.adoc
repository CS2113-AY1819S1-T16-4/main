== Introduction

Centralised Human Resource System (CHRS) is for the human resource personnel who use a desktop to manage the employee’s information. More importantly, CHRS is optimized for personnel with the preference of working with a Command Line Interface while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). After familiarizing with the CLI functions, CHRS can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or newer installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `CHRS.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all employee details
* **`add`**`n/John Doe dob/21-01-1993 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com d/Finance r/Intern a/John street, block 123, #01-01 s/600`: adds an employee named `John Doe` to CHRS.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the employee with the employee id '3' in CHRS
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
