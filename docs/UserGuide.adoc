== Introduction

Centralised Human Resource System (CHRS) is for the human resource personnel who use a desktop to manage the employee’s information. More importantly, CHRS is optimized for personnel with the preference of working with a Command Line Interface while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). After familiarizing with the CLI functions, CHRS can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `CHRS.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Centralised Human Resource System.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
