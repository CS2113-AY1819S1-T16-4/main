* Centralised Human Resource System (CHRS) application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* CHRS is targeted at the Human Resource (HR) department.
* As the HR department requires access to various information of each employee, it may be difficult for them to obtain the required information if they are stored in various systems or databases.
* Therefore, CHRS aims to help the HR department to store all the relevant information related to each employee within one system.
* CHRS is developed by group T16-4 from the module CS2113 in National University of Singapore (NUS).
